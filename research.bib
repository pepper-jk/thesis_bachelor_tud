  abstract = {In this paper, a multiresolution finite-impulse-response (FIR) neural-network-based learning algorithm using the maximal overlap discrete wavelet transform (MODWT) is proposed. The multiresolution learning algorithm employs the analysis framework of wavelet theory, which decomposes a signal into wavelet coefficients and scaling coefficients. The translation-invariant property of the MODWT allows alignment of events in a multiresolution analysis with respect to the original time series and, therefore, preserving the integrity of some transient events. A learning algorithm is also derived for adapting the gain of the activation functions at each level of resolution. The proposed multiresolution FIR neural-network-based learning algorithm is applied to network traffic prediction (real-world aggregate Ethernet traffic data) with comparable results. These results indicate that the generalization ability of the FIR neural network is improved by the proposed multiresolution learning algorithm.},

  abstract = {The difficulty of quantifying the accuracy of intrusion detection tools against real network data mandates that researchers use simulated attack data for the partial evaluation of such tools. In 1998 and 1999 researchers at MIT Lincoln Labs produced datasets both with and without attack data specifically for use by those interested in developing intrusion detection tools. Because self-similarity has been shown to be a statistical property of real network traffic, this paper examines the attack-free datasets for the presence of self-similarity in various time periods. The results offer insight for researchers who may wish to use specific subsets of the data for testing. Where the results indicate a lack of self-similarity in the data, the likely cause was determined to be either a low activity level or traffic that was dominated by a single protocol, thus forcing the overall distribution to match its own.},

It allows operators to better predict future traffic matrices and demands, security personnel to detect anomalous behavior, and researchers to develop more realistic traffic models. We present here a traffic classifier that can achieve a high accuracy across a range of application types without any source or destination host-address or port information. We use supervised machine learning based on a Bayesian trained neural network. Though our technique uses training data with categories derived from packet content, training and testing were done using features derived from packet streams consisting of one or more packet headers. By providing classification without access to the contents of packets, our technique offers wider application than methods that require full packet/payloads for classification. This is a powerful advantage, using samples of classified traffic to permit the categorization of traffic based only upon commonly available information},

  abstract = {Neural machine translation is a recently proposed approach to machine translation. Unlike the traditional statistical machine translation, the neural machine translation aims at building a single neural network that can be jointly tuned to maximize the translation performance. The models proposed recently for neural machine translation often belong to a family of encoder-decoders and consists of an encoder that encodes a source sentence into a fixed-length vector from which a decoder generates a translation. In this paper, we conjecture that the use of a fixed-length vector is a bottleneck in improving the performance of this basic encoder-decoder architecture, and propose to extend this by allowing a model to automatically (soft-)search for parts of a source sentence that are relevant to predicting a target word, without having to form these parts as a hard segment explicitly. With this new approach, we achieve a translation performance comparable to the existing state-of-the-art phrase-based system on the task of English-to-French translation. Furthermore, qualitative analysis reveals that the (soft-)alignments found by the model agree well with our intuition.},

One RNN encodes a sequence of symbols into a fixed-length vector representation, and the other decodes the representation into another sequence of symbols. The encoder and decoder of the proposed model are jointly trained to maximize the conditional probability of a target sequence given a source sequence. The performance of a statistical machine translation system is empirically found to improve by using the conditional probabilities of phrase pairs computed by the RNN Encoder-Decoder as an additional feature in the existing log-linear model. Qualitatively, we show that the proposed model learns a semantically and syntactically meaningful representation of linguistic phrases.},

  abstract = {Neural machine translation is a relatively new approach to statistical machine translation based purely on neural networks. The neural machine translation models often consist of an encoder and a decoder. The encoder extracts a fixed-length representation from a variable-length input sentence, and the decoder generates a correct translation from this representation. In this paper, we focus on analyzing the properties of the neural machine translation using two models; RNN Encoder--Decoder and a newly proposed gated recursive convolutional neural network. We show that the neural machine translation performs relatively well on short sentences without unknown words, but its performance degrades rapidly as the length of the sentence and the number of unknown words increase. Furthermore, we find that the proposed gated recursive convolutional network learns a grammatical structure of a sentence automatically.},

Moreover we show how, by exploiting such temporal dependencies, the model is able to perform short-term prediction by observing traffic from real sources.},

We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.},

Further, we present a new method for evaluating the generated flow-based network traffic which uses domain knowledge to define quality tests. We use the three approaches for generating flow-based network traffic based on the CIDDS-001 data set. Experiments indicate that two of the three approaches are able to generate high quality data.},

  abstract = {Researchers have presented freeway traffic incident-detection algorithms by combining the adaptive learning capability of neural networks with imprecision modeling capability of fuzzy logic. In this article it is shown that the performance of a fuzzy neural network algorithm can be improved through preprocessing of data using a wavelet-based feature-extraction model. In particular, the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) denoising and feature-extraction model proposed by Samant and Adeli (2000) is combined with the fuzzy neural network approach presented by Hsiao et al. (1994). It is shown that substantial improvement can be achieved using the data filtered by DWT. Use of the wavelet theory to denoise the traffic data increases the incident-detection rate, reduces the false-alarm rate and the incident-detection time, and improves the convergence of the neural network training algorithm substantially.},

  abstract = {This paper presents the use of a basic ARIMA model for network traffic prediction and anomaly detection. Accurate network traffic modeling and prediction are important for network provisioning and problem diagnosis, but network traffic is highly dynamic. To achieve better modeling and prediction it is needed to isolate anomalies from normal traffic variation. Thus, we decompose traffic signals into two parts normal variations, that follow certain law and are predictable and, anomalies that consist of sudden changes and are not predictable. ARIMA analysis and modeling for network traffic prediction is able to detect and identify volume anomaly or outliers.},
